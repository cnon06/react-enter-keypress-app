Creating a React app that listens for the Enter keypress event and responds to it can be done in a few simple steps. In this example, we'll create a simple input field that allows you to type text and press Enter to display an alert with the entered text. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Let's start by creating a new React app and adding the required functionality:

1. Create a new React app using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app enter-keypress-app
cd enter-keypress-app
```

2. In the `src` directory, create a new component called `EnterKeyPress.js`:

```jsx
// src/EnterKeyPress.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const EnterKeyPress = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleKeyPress = (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
      alert(`You pressed Enter with the text: ${text}`);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Enter KeyPress App</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Type something and press Enter"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default EnterKeyPress;
```

3. Modify the `src/App.js` file to use the `EnterKeyPress` component:

```jsx
// src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import EnterKeyPress from './EnterKeyPress';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <EnterKeyPress />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. Now, you can run your React app:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start your development server, and you can open your app in a web browser. You'll see a simple input field, and when you type something and press Enter, an alert will appear displaying the text you entered.

That's it! You've created a basic React app that responds to the Enter keypress event. You can further customize and enhance this app to suit your needs.
